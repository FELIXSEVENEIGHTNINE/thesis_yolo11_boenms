## Thesis Introduction
A capstone thesis related to reducing latency in YOLOv11 by implementing BOE-NMS using Household E-Waste. <br/>
An online repository was used as a training dataset but uses taken photos of local household e-wastes for testing and validation. <br/>
It uses comparative analysis on YOLO11, RT-DETR, and YOLO11 /w BOE-NMS. <br/>

## Methodology
R: we should improve accuracy <br/>
D: we should make it faster <br/>
S: we should improve the metrics <br/>
R: we should take yolov11 and implement boe-nms! <br/>
D: that idea might just be crazy enough... TO GET US FAILED <br/>

## Results
ofc it beat base yolo and rtdetr in terms of latency but rtdetr wins in terms of evaluation metrics because both yolos were the same metrics

## Future Recommendations:
- maybe not screw up the annotation and bounding boxes of the secondary dataset
- since yolo11 is better yolo8, replace the dataset with videos cuz thats the main purpose of yolo8 archi


###### honestly idk ts pmo idk wtf happening with my other two groupmates... one is literally a ghost but did the code the other one is too stubborn and i would get lost in a maze if i followed him... i was busy with empl*yment and we decided to do it a day before submission ðŸ¥€

## Thesis Introduction
A capstone thesis related to reducing latency in YOLOv11 by implementing BOE-NMS using Household E-Waste. 
An online repository was used as a training dataset but uses taken photos of local household e-wastes for testing and validation.
It uses comparative analysis on YOLO11, RT-DETR, and YOLO11 /w BOE-NMS.

## Future Recommendations:
- maybe not screw up the annotation and bounding boxes of the secondary dataset
- since yolo11 is better yolo8, replace the dataset with videos cuz thats the main purpose of yolo8 archi


###### honestly idk ts pmo idk wtf happening with my other two groupmates... one is literally a ghost but did the code the other one is too stubborn and i would get lost in a maze if i followed him... i was busy with empl*yment and we decided to do it a day before submission ðŸ¥€
